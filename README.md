# SVG-Generator

## Description

SVG Generator is a simple Node.js application that will automatically create an SVG Logo for you to implement into any of your HTML builds!  Simply enter ```node {main.js}``` into the CLI at the directory of your choice and you will be prompted to enter your preferences.  This will determine what text to list, the color of the text and logo respectively, and the shape of the logo.

The app will output a file named "logo.svg" complete with XML code written within.

The application itself uses Inquirer and fs to relay prompts through the command line and write the new file, respectively, as well as inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt to determine the max-length of the text added.
